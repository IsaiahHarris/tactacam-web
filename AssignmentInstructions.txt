Web Developer Coding Assessment 
Listed below are the requirements for our React coding assignment. We anticipate the coding  assignment to take between 2-4 hours to complete. Please reach out via email if you have any  questions or need any additional information/clarification. Good luck and we look forward to  seeing what you come up with! 

• Using React, write a website that calls the Unsplash API to search a list of photos and  displays the thumbnails in a grid. (https://unsplash.com/documentation#search photos i.e. GET /search/photos?page=1&query=dog) 

• When the user scrolls to the bottom of the page, the next page of photos should be  loaded automatically and displayed (infinite scroll). 
• Clicking a photo should navigate the user to a details route that displays the full-size  photo along with some of the photo metadata (user name, like count, etc.) 

• &&& On the main page, user should be able to filter by color and orientation (see parameters  section of documentation https://unsplash.com/documentation#parameters-16) 

• Styling should be responsive, i.e. when shrunk down to mobile width, only one column  should be displayed. Feel free to use any CSS framework/styling library you please. 

• Code should be provided via a Git repository pushed to your Git provider of choice (if  repo is private, it should be shared with the interviewer). Alternatively, email a .zip of  the Git repo to the interviewer. 

NOTE: You can register for free demo Unsplash API access via https://unsplash.com/join.  Alternatively you can use our demo key, HTTP Authorization header with a value of Client-ID  DwNmIS2gLAqsacMm7jmfQdLqgLQEy3tTOBy_wu0gBUI to make your requests. Demo requests  are rate limited to 50 requests per hour, so feel free to hardcode the response data in the code  sample you provide (whatever is easiest for you).
